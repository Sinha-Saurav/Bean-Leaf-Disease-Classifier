# 🌱 Bean Leaf Disease Classifier

A deep learning–based web app built with **PyTorch** and **Streamlit** to classify bean leaf images into three categories:

- **Angular Leaf Spot**
- **Bean Rust**
- **Healthy Leaf**

This tool can help farmers and researchers quickly identify common bean leaf diseases from simple images.
